        <h3>Man's favourite snack</h3>
        <p>This is a simple butter cookie that can be used in a cookie press, as a drop cookie or made into a roll and sliced. There is no mystery cookie for a cookie press...any stiff butter type can be used. Just be sure to chill it thoroughly so it keeps its shape while baking.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup butter</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2 and a third cups flour</li>
            <li>1 quarter tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, cream together the butter and white sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour and salt; stir into the sugar mixture. Cover dough, and chill for at least one hour. Chill cookie sheets.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Press dough out onto ungreased, chilled cookie sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until lightly golden at the edges. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.</li>
        </ol>
